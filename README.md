Automated Threat Intelligence & Blacklist Management Tool
This tool integrates IoC (Indicators of Compromise) analysis with automated security actions, enabling real-time threat detection and response. It scans IP addresses using AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal, then automatically takes action based on predefined risk thresholds.

Key Features
IoC Analysis: Fetches threat intelligence data from AbuseIPDB and VirusTotal.
Automated Blacklisting: Adds malicious IPs to Fortigate's "AutomationBlacklist" group.
Timed Removal: IPs are automatically removed after 12 hours, ensuring dynamic threat mitigation.
Seamless Integration: Works with Fortigate firewalls for real-time security enforcement.
Development Status
- This project is actively being developed, and continuous optimizations are being implemented.
- Future updates will enhance efficiency, expand integrations, and introduce advanced threat response mechanisms.

Use Case
Ideal for SOC teams, security engineers, and threat intelligence analysts who want to automate the detection and response to malicious IPs without manual intervention.
